# TODO: Fix "Failed to fetch" Error

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Analyze the error: Identified CORS origin mismatch as likely cause.
- [x] Add "https://krushnrajsinhjadeja.com" to CORS origins in backend/app.js for both production and development.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Deploy the backend changes to Railway (nodejs-production-da51.up.railway.app).
- [ ] Test the contact form and project loading on the live site (https://krushnrajsinhjadeja.com).
- [ ] If error persists, check Network tab in DevTools for request details and verify server logs.
- [ ] Optionally, add more logging to fetch calls in client/script.js for better debugging.
- [ ] Confirm DNS is properly configured (A record for krushnrajsinhjadeja.com points to Vercel).
