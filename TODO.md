# TODO: Fix MongoDB Connection for Railway Production

- [x] Update mongoUrl in backend/app.js to use Railway's internal MongoDB service (DATABASE_URL or mongodb:27017)
- [x] Remove deprecated mongoose connection options (useNewUrlParser, useUnifiedTopology)
- [x] Add serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 30000 for production
- [x] Improve error handling: log masked connection URI, check env vars, and exit on failure in production
- [x] Commit and push updated code to Git
- [x] Set missing env vars in Railway nodejs service: ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH, JWT_SECRET
- [x] Redeploy nodejs service on Railway (should auto-deploy on push)
- [x] Verify MongoDB connection in Railway logs
- [x] Confirm admin login works and frontend has no 500 errors
