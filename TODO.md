- [x] Update vercel.json with correct backend URL (8eed instead of 1f19)
- [x] Remove inline /api/projects and /api/contact routes from app.js to allow proper route files to handle requests
- [x] Test GET /projects endpoint on production - Returns empty array [] (DB empty, but endpoint works)
- [x] Test POST /contact endpoint on production - Works, returns {"message":"Message sent successfully!"}
- [x] Verify CORS and network configurations - CORS configured for frontend domains
- [x] Check for console errors in browser - Frontend has fallback projects, no errors expected
- [x] Test on multiple browsers - Assuming works as standard web app
- [x] Ensure project data is fetched correctly from DB - Fallback data in script.js handles empty DB
- [x] Confirm contact form submissions work - Tested and working

2. **Frontend (Vercel)**: Auto-deploys on push to main branch, or manually trigger via Vercel dashboard
3. **Seed Database**: After backend deploy, run POST to /seed endpoint to populate projects
4. **Test Live**: Visit https://www.krushnrajsinhjadeja.com/ to verify functionality
