# TODO: Fix "Failed to fetch" Error

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Analyze the error: Identified CORS origin mismatch as likely cause.
- [x] Add "https://krushnrajsinhjadeja.com" to CORS origins in backend/app.js for both production and development.
- [x] Require JWT_SECRET env var in backend/app.js.
- [x] Fix rate limiter to skip Railway health checks and basic routes in backend/middleware/security.js.
- [x] Update seed.js to use production MongoDB URL.
- [x] Add seed script to backend/package.json.
- [x] Run seed script locally to populate projects.
- [x] Revert Railway URL back to nodejs-production-da51.up.railway.app in vercel.json and backend/app.js.
- [x] Fix frontend URLs in admin-dashboard.html and login.html to use nodejs-production-da51.up.railway.app.
- [x] Push changes to GitHub.
- [x] Test backend API endpoints: /api/projects returns [], /api/test returns 404, / returns "Backend is running".

## Next Steps

- [ ] Update DNS A record for krushnrajsinhjadeja.com to point to the IP Vercel provides (216.198.79.1 as shown in Vercel dashboard, currently set to 216.198.79.160 in Porkbun).
- [ ] Deploy the backend changes to Railway (nodejs-production-da51.up.railway.app) - set JWT_SECRET env var.
- [ ] Run seed script on Railway to populate projects in production DB.
- [ ] Test the contact form and project loading on the live site (https://krushnrajsinhjadeja.com).
- [ ] If error persists, check Network tab in DevTools for request details and verify server logs.
- [ ] Optionally, add more logging to fetch calls in client/script.js for better debugging.
